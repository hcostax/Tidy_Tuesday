TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project in R which encourages participants to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. More information can be found on this project at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday. 


# Tidy Tuesday contributions

Goal here is to get better at ggplot, so I hope these improve over time and let me try out new techniques!

### Ask a Manager Survey

The data this week comes from the [Ask a Manager Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPS5dBSGtwYVbjsfbaMCYIWnOuRmJcbequohNxCyGVw/edit?resourcekey#gid=1625408792). H/t to [Kaija Gahm](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/340) for sharing it as an issue!

> The salary survey a few weeks ago got a huge response — 24,000+ people shared their salaries and other info, which is a lot of raw data to sift through. Reader Elisabeth Engl kindly took the raw data and analyzed some of the trends in it and here’s what she found. (She asked me to note that she did this as a fun project to share some insights from the survey, rather than as a paid engagement.)

> This data does not reflect the general population; it reflects Ask a Manager readers who self-selected to respond, which is a very different group (as you can see just from the demographic breakdown below, which is very white and very female).

Elisabeth Engl prepped some plots for the [Ask a Manager blog](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/05/some-findings-from-24000-peoples-salaries.html) using this data.

The survey itself is available [here](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html).
